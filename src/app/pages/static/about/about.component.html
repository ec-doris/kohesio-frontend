            <p class="ecl-u-type-paragraph">The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/2021_2027/" target="_blank">EU Cohesion Policy</a> supports hundreds of thousands of projects across Europe, through funding programmes managed by national and regional authorities in collaboration with the European Commission.</p>
            <p class="ecl-u-type-paragraph">The Kohesio project aims at creating a knowledge base of EU co-funded projects and beneficiaries that is accessible to the public. It uses <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/" target="_blank">W3C</a> open standards and open-source tools provided by <a href="https://wikimedia.de/" target="_blank">Wikimedia Deutschland</a>.</p>
            <p class="ecl-u-type-paragraph"><b>Kohesio is still in development</b>. At the moment, Kohesio contains data on projects funded during the 2014-2020 programming period across several EU Member States. Kohesio covers three EU-funds: European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), Cohesion Fund (CF), and European Social Fund (ESF).</p>
            <p class="ecl-u-type-paragraph">More data from Member States will progressively enrich Kohesio.</p>
